# Digital Health Monitor

## Aim
The main goal of the project is to develop a machine learning system that analyzes patient health data and creates a digital twin of the patient.
The system should be able to predict the risk of developing certain health conditions based on the patient's genetic make-up, age, gender, congenital and/or acquired chronic medical conditions, family history, and other relevant factors.
The system should also be able to monitor the patient's health in real-time, predicting potential health risks and alerting healthcare providers to take preventative action.
Additionally, the system should be able to simulate the effects of different treatment options and predict which treatment plan will be most effective for the patient.
